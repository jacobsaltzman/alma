# Alma Cider Frontend

## Introduction
  
 
A single-page, frontend website for Alma Cider built using React by Jacob Saltzman. 


## Description


This project's focus is showcasing **Alma**, all of its ciders, awards, and the family that built it. The idea was for a fairly simple website that shows pictures and details of all they have and do there at Alma.

The website opens to a home page that serves as a simple landing pad for the nav bar sections and showcases the logo and the contact information. From there, users can navigate to "pages", starting with the **Ciders** to access the details for those plus their respectice awards, or to the  **Services** that describe the grafting services they also provide, or to the **Retailers** to see a comprehensive list of where users can find Alma products being sold in stores, or lastly, the **About Us** component which fills the user in on the 'Who, What, When, Where, and Why' of the Alma story.
